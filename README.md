# ISTA 421 Final Project

Requirements:
```
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
````

The code can be run in jupyter lab, as it is a jupyter notebook.  It will need the `survey_results_public.csv` file available to load.


All figures for this project are generated in the one notebook.  I do include some figures from homework 3 (mentioned in the report as a _previous assignment_).
